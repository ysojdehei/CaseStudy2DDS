# CaseStudy2DDS

Given the dataset (CaseStudy2-data.csv), data analysis was conducted to identify factors that leading to attrition.  The top three factors that contribute to turnover were found as seen in the .html file of the analysis. Derived attributes/variables/features were created..... The business is also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”). You can also provide any other interesting trends and observations from your analysis. Experiments and analysis conducted in R.

Results:

Creating a predictive model to predict attrition led us to the conclusion that, OverTime, MonthlyIncome, TotalWorkingYears, to have the highest relations with Attrition. Using variables in the dataset we were able to predict Attrition with an average Accuracy rate about 82 percent, Sensitvity at 87 percent, and specificty at about 60 percent.
The regression model to predict employee salary had an adjusted r-squared value of about 95 percent, and an RMSE of about 1025.
